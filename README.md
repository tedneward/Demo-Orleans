# Demo-Orleans
A collection of Microsoft Orleans demos to go along with my presentations.

***NOTE:*** As with any demo code, none of this is guaranteed to do anything except occupy space on your hard drive. Lots of things have been kept out of the code for pedagogical purposes (like sane error handling and/or any of the other useful/necessary patterns for distributed systems), so for your own sake and sanity, don't cut-and-paste from here into production code. Use this as a learning exercise, not a shortcut to prod.

## HelloWorld
Exactly what it sounds like: HelloWorld, for Orleans. Simplest Orleans program possible.

## Chirper
This is the first of what will likely be many Twitter clones, inspired by the Orleans sample of the same name. Updated for .NET 6 and Orleans 3.0.
